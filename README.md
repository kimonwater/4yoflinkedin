> [4y of LinkedIn, A Dashboard](https://kimonwater.github.io/4yoflinkedin/)

- based on 72 posts in google looker (horrific loading time but amazingly seamless) and a mobile gh page workaround

- post data can be exported (for 1000d)

- btw [other data can be requested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data) and [an api](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/member-data-portability/member-data-portability-member/) exists 

- best to simplify an own data model, nth fancy 🙏🏽

- mobile workaround through 2 separate dashboards embedded into a basic gh page

- reach out for questions anytime 🖤
